## ASAPPpy
ASAPPpy is a Python package for developing models to compute the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between texts in Portuguese. These models follow a supervised learning approach to learn an STS function from annotated sentence pairs, considering a variety of lexical, syntactic, semantic and distributional features.

ASAPPpy can also be used to develop STS based dialogue agents and deploy them to Slack.


### Development
If you want to contribute to this project, please follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).


### Installation
To install the latest version of ASAPPpy use the following command:
```bash
pip install ASAPPpy
```
After finishing the installation, you might need to download the word embeddings models. Given that they were obtained from various sources, we collected them and they can be downloaded at once by running the Python interpreter in your terminal followed by these commands:
```python
import ASAPPpy
ASAPPpy.download()
```
Finally, if you have never used [spaCy](https://spacy.io) before and you want to use the dependency parsing features, you will need to run the next command in the terminal:
```bash
python -m spacy download pt
```

Alternatively, you can check the latest version of ASAPPpy using this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZPedroP/ASAPPpy.git
```

### Project History
ASAP(P) is the name of a collection of systems developed by the [Natural Language Processing group](http://nlp.dei.uc.pt) at [CISUC](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/home) for computing STS based on a regression method and a set of lexical, syntactic, semantic and distributional features extracted from text.
It was used to participate in several STS evaluation tasks, for English and Portuguese, but was only recently integrated into two single independent frameworks: ASAPPpy (available here), in Python, and ASAPPj, in Java.
